name: previs
version: '0.4.0'
summary: Your very own local CI!
description: |
  Previs is using the travis configuration file to provide your own local service of continous integration.
  No more accidental error that trigger a fail build, no more plumbing on your git history. 
  But more than a local trevis, it provides you a way of testing in a sandboxed environment.
